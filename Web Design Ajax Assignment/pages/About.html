    Here at Games Watch, we strive to make managing and rating your games easier.
    By providing you with your own games library. Further more, we have also employed
    a brand new information gathering system called wikipedia api, that looks at your
    game and gives you info about it when you click on its info button. Our system also
    allows you, our user, to sort and filter through your library in order to find what you
    are looking for quicker.
