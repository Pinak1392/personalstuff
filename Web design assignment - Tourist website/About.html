      <h1>About Canberra Tourism</h1>
      <p>
         Canberra Tourism was created back in 1985 under the name Canberra Tourist Advisory. <br>
         It was a rocky start, with many people that we approached for sponsorships, turning us away.<br>
         But, we braved through, and eventually struck a merger deal with Tourism Canberra in 1998. <br>
         Since then we have changed our name to Canberra Tourism. We are also proud to announce that <br>
         as of 2015, we have gotten our own mascot named David the Dog. Who has brought in many customers<br>
         Currently we cover about 76% of Canberra. But, we hope to make that 80% by the end of the year.
       </p>

       <p>
         As for what we do. We do what we love most. Helping the people of Canberra have a good time. <br>
         If you want to find a certain place in Canberra, we have it. As Steve Jobs once said, "We have <br>
         an app for that", here at Canberra Tourism our saying is, "We have a place for that." Whether <br>
         it is entertainment, recreation or relaxation. We know where you need to go, and we can even <br>
         tell you the events going on there as well. So that you don't need to research. In the future <br>
         we are looking to add phone alerts, so if you are a member, look out for it in the future.
